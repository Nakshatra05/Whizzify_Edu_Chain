## Project Overview

Whizzify aims to empower educational institutions and organizations with an easy-to-use tool for creating quizzes based on course or session content. The platform automatically generates quiz questions from the provided material and rewards participants instantly for correct answers, fostering active learning and engagement.

## Problem

Educational institutions often face challenges in assessing learner engagement and managing rewards:
- **Manual Quiz Creation**: Designing quiz questions that accurately reflect course material is time-consuming and often inconsistent.
- **Reward Management**: Distributing rewards manually can be cumbersome, error-prone, and lacks transparency.
- **Learner Engagement**: Encouraging active participation can be difficult without immediate and motivating incentives.

## Solution

Whizzify addresses these challenges with:
- **Automated Quiz Generation**: Upload course content, and Whizzify generates relevant quiz questions.
- **Instant Rewards**: Learners receive rewards instantly through wallets compatible with the Arbitrum Orbit ecosystem for correct answers.
- **Seamless Integration**: A streamlined process where educators provide the content and initial funds for rewards, and Whizzify manages the rest.

## Technologies Used

- **EDU Chain on Arbitrum Orbit**: To ensure secure, transparent, and scalable reward distribution.
- **ChatGPT API**: To process educational content and generate engaging quiz questions.
- **Ethereum-Compatible Wallets**: For handling learner rewards (e.g., Metamask).
